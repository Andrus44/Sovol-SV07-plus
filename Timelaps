Absolutely, Andrus — here is a **clean, chronological, copy‑paste‑ready summary** of *everything you did*, including PuTTY steps, commands, file edits, and what you copied.  
This is the exact recipe that made Moonraker‑Timelapse work on your Sovol SV07 Plus.

# 🧩 **Full Step‑By‑Step Summary: Installing Moonraker‑Timelapse on Sovol SV07 Plus**

Below is the complete process in the order you actually performed it.

---

# 🟦 1. **Connected to the printer using PuTTY**
- Entered the printer’s IP address  
- Logged in as:

```
username: mks
password: makerbase
```

(You started as root, but the working user was `mks`.)

---

# 🟦 2. **Cloned the timelapse repository**
You moved into your home directory and cloned the repo:

```
cd /home/mks
git clone https://github.com/mainsail-crew/moonraker-timelapse.git
```

---

# 🟦 3. **Found the installer script**
You checked the folder:

```
ls -la /home/mks/moonraker-timelapse
```

The installer was inside:

```
/home/mks/moonraker-timelapse/scripts/install.sh
```

---

# 🟦 4. **Installer refused to run**
The script exited with:

```
YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN INSTALLER AS ROOT!
```

And when forced, it tried to use `apt`, which fails on Sovol firmware.

So the installer could not be used.

---

# 🟦 5. **Manually installed the plugin (the correct method)**

### ✔️ Step into the component folder:

```
cd /home/mks/moonraker-timelapse/component
ls
```

You saw:

```
timelapse.py
```

### ✔️ Copy the plugin into Moonraker’s components directory:

```
cp /home/mks/moonraker-timelapse/component/timelapse.py /home/mks/moonraker/moonraker/components/
```

### ✔️ Verify it:

```
ls /home/mks/moonraker/moonraker/components
```

You now saw:

```
timelapse.py
```

---

# 🟦 6. **Restarted Moonraker**

```
systemctl restart moonraker
```

---

# 🟦 7. **Checked logs to confirm plugin loaded**

```
grep -n "timelapse" /home/mks/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log
```

The log showed:

```
Component (timelapse) loaded
```

This confirmed the plugin was active.

---

# 🟦 8. **Fixed the config warning**
You opened the Moonraker config:

```
nano /home/mks/printer_data/config/moonraker.conf
```

Inside nano:

- **CTRL+O** → save  
- **ENTER** → confirm  
- **CTRL+X** → exit  

You removed the unsupported line:

```
frame_rate: 30
```

Leaving:

```
[timelapse]
output_path: ~/printer_data/timelapse/
```

Restarted Moonraker again:

```
systemctl restart moonraker
```

---

# 🟦 9. **Result**
- The **Timelapse** menu appeared in Fluidd  
- The plugin loaded cleanly  
- The printer ran normally  
- No apt updates, no OS modifications, no risk  

You now have a fully working timelapse system on Sovol’s locked-down firmware.
